## What is this?

This is a tiny utility that you can use to find a node before another node or
before an index in a parent.

## When should I use this?

This is super tiny.
You can of course do it yourself.
But this helps when integrating with the rest of unified and unist.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, 16.0+, 18.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install unist-util-find-before
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import {findBefore} from "https://esm.sh/unist-util-find-before@3"
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {findBefore} from "https://esm.sh/unist-util-find-before@3?bundle"
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {u} from 'unist-builder'
import {findBefore} from 'unist-util-find-before'

const tree = u('tree', [
  u('leaf', 'leaf 1'),
  u('parent', [u('leaf', 'leaf 2'), u('leaf', 'leaf 3')]),
  u('leaf', 'leaf 4'),
  u('parent', [u('leaf', 'leaf 5')]),
  u('leaf', 'leaf 6'),
  u('empty'),
  u('leaf', 'leaf 7')
])

const empty = tree.children[5]

console.log(findBefore(tree, empty, 'parent'))
```

Yields:

```js
{type: 'parent', children: [{type: 'leaf', value: 'leaf 5'}]}
```

## API

This package exports the identifier `findBefore`.
There is no default export.

### `findBefore(parent, node|index[, test])`

Find the first node in `parent` ([`Parent`][parent]) before another `node`
([`Node`][node]) or before an index, that passes `test` (`Test` from
[`unist-util-is`][test]).

###### Returns

Child of `parent` that passes `test`, if found ([`Node?`][node]).

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports no additional types (types for the test are in `unist-util-is`).

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with all maintained
versions of Node.js.
As of now, that is Node.js 12.20+, 14.14+, 16.0+, and 18.0+.
Our projects sometimes work with older versions, but this is not guaranteed.
